### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I became interested in web and software development when I learned about AI pair programming. Since then, I have been working with ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to work on a number of different projects to cover all of the different languages, frameworks, tools, etc. I've always been interested in. 

One thing AI can't help me with is work experience. I'd love to continue learning about different technologies while working in a group that's creating projects that people care about. I've currently been focusing on Python, JavaScript and Go for my projects, but I'll be expanding to languages like Java and C++ before long. Contact me if you have or just know about some hiring opportunities that would give me some work experience.
